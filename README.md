# Predatory Journal Blocker (PJB)
Predatory Journal Blocker is a practical browser extension for Chromium based browsers such as Google Chrome, Opera or Vivaldi.

This plugin utilizes the work done by revengeday/axelspringerblocker


# Installation  

## Chromium based brwosers except Google Chrome (Opera, Vivaldi, Microsoft Edge, ...)
  - Open the site handling browser extensions (commonly found under the settings tab)
  - drag and drop the Chromium.crx into the windows, then press accept in the pop-ups regarding extension installation

    
    
## Chrome
   Google Chrome requires brwoser extensions to be published in the chrome web store. To circumvent this, we will use the brwosers develeoper mode.
   To publish this extension in the chrome web store costs money. Since I'm stingy, I didn't. If you want this extension in the app store, feel free t ocontact me

   - Download the respository and extract it
   - Open the Extesnion site
   - active the developer mode (top right at time of writing)
   - click "load extracted extension"
   - select the extracted chromium folder
   - You've fisnihed, yuheii

    
    
    
## Firefox 

Firefox support has not been done by me and will not be done, since I don't know anything about making firefox plugins. If you know how create how to do this, or want to do it, feel free to create an issue or pull request.

# Changes to the list

The list of predatory journals was kindly provided by some chemistry students wo where sick of predatory journals in their research. If you would like to add an item to the list or inform me about a wrongful listing of a journal feel free to add an issue :)
